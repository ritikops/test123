The difference between **Git** and **GitHub** is:

### **1. Git**
- **What it is:** A distributed version control system (VCS).
- **Purpose:** Helps track changes in source code and manage code versions.
- **Installation:** Installed locally on your computer.
- **Usage:** Works independently and can be used without the internet.
- **Key Features:** Branching, merging, commit history, and rollback.
- **Example Command:**  
  ```sh
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

### **2. GitHub**
- **What it is:** A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.
- **Purpose:** Stores Git repositories online for collaboration.
- **Installation:** No installation needed, accessed via a web interface.
- **Usage:** Requires an internet connection to push and pull code.
- **Key Features:** Remote repository hosting, pull requests, issue tracking, and team collaboration.
- **Example Usage:**  
  ```sh
  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### **Main Difference:**
| Feature      | Git | GitHub |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| Type | Version control system | Cloud-based repository hosting |
| Works Offline | Yes | No (requires internet) |
| Collaboration | No, local only | Yes, team collaboration features |
| Hosting | No | Yes, stores repositories online |
| GUI Interface | No (CLI-based) | Yes, web-based UI |

#### **Conclusion:**
- **Git** is a tool for managing source code versions locally.
- **GitHub** is a platform that hosts Git repositories for online collaboration.
